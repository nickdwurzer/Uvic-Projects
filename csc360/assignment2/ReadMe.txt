First run the makefile.
Ensure that the input file you wish to test is in the same directory as mts.
Run mts with one argument -the input file you wish to test.
For example, I currently run './mts input1.txt'

Some code borrowed from loading_train.c provided by Jianping Pan at University of Victoria.

I have not had the time that I would like to dedicate towards this assignment, so it is not complete.
The parts that I have completed so far are: 
1)Reading the input file.
2)Creating the correct number trains based on that input.
3)Loading trains based on the specified input time.

Design changes:
I have changed from using a linked list, to a dynamic array since it was easier to impliment.
