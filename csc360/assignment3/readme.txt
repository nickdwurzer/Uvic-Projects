I haven't able to dedicate the time to this assignment that I would like to, so I have only completed diskinfo.c and the status of each file in disklist.c at the moment.

diskinfo.c can be ran by first compiling using the 'make' command and then running './diskinfo <dmg file path>'.
disklist.c can be ran by first compiling using the 'make' command and then running './disklist <dmg file path>'.
I have included the file test.dmg in p3.tar.gz, so for instance when testing my code, I ran ./diskinfo test.dmg.
