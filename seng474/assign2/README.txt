To run my code, unzip code.tar and within the fashion_mnist folder you can run a2.py with ./a2.py.

fashion_mnist folder is a copy of the github repo found here https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist.

a2.py utilizes the datasets in the repo as well as utils.py for loading the data in python.

When the code is run, two figures should be displayed and the confidence interval of the SVM and Logistic regression models after conducting k-fold validation should be printed to console.
