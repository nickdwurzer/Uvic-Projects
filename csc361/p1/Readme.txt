How to run SmartClient.py:
It is executable and can be run like './SmartClient.py www.examplewebsite.com/file'

or with 'python3 ./SmartClient.py www.examplewebsite.com/file'

I worked really hard on this assignment, however I didn't quite meet all the requirements.

My code can tell when a password is required by gathering the error code, however it does not call that method every time.  In order to finish this assignment I would need to figure out how to form a GET request with http2, and I would also need to restructure my code to so that each time it runs it will check if it is password protected.  My code also does not handle errors currently.
