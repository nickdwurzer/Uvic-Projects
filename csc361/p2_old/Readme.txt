To run this program, ensure that tcpsummary.py is executable and execute 
the program with the name of the desired capture file if the capture file 
is in the same directory as the executable, or ithe capture file's absolute
 path as the only argument.

For example I ran './tcpsummary.py sample-capture-file.cap' to test my program.
